# BeyondBody

This is a WinForm application that allows people to move the mouse and do clicks by moving head and blinking eyes.

It has several modules:
- Sign in Configuration, where you Sign in through a face recognition process
- Gestures, where you configure gestures with the mouth for writting specific words
- Training mode
- Among others (will have to right later xP)

Used technologies and libraries are:
- Visual Studio 2012
- EmguCv (OpenCv for C#)
- WinForm
- Haarcascades

## Detailed Documentation

You can find detailed documentation about beyondbody into the 'doc' folder beside 'src' folder.

### Instructions before compiling

GitHub only let us upload files smaller than 100mb, so I had to compress one of the dlls in order to upload all the files.

So once you clone the proyect you will have to unzip the 'opencv_gpu240.zip' file and you're done.

### Requirements for developing

The proyect is made with c# in visual studio 2012.

### Requirements for running the app

In order to run the program correctly you need:

- At least one camera connected to the PC

[Optionaly] To activate the voice functionality you need: 

- the program Dragon Naturally Speaking installed and running on your machine
