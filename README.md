# BeyondBody

This is an WinForm application that allows people to move the mouse and do clicks by moving head and blinking eyes.

It has several modules:
- Login in Configuration, where you login through a face recognition process
- Gestures, where you configure gestures with the mouth for writting specific words
- Training mode
- Among others (will have to right later xP)

Used technologies and libraries are:
- Visual Studio 2012
- EmguCv (OpenCv for C#)
- WinForm
- Haarcascades

## Detailed Documentation

You can find detailed but outdated documentation about beyondbody into the 'doc' folder beside 'src' folder.

## About me

This is also the result of a year of hard work. With this project I graduated at the university in december 2014.
I want to thank my university team for helping me developing this app.

## Goal

It 'd be great anyone can continue this work and let others now about beyondbody, the main reason the application was made is that people with upper limb dissabilities could use a computer in an easier way.

### Instructions before compiling

GitHub only let us upload files smaller than 100mb, so I had to compress one of the dlls in order to upload all the files.

So once you clone the proyect you will have to unzip the 'opencv_gpu240.zip' file and you're done.

### Requirements for developing

The proyect is made with c# in visual studio 2012.

### Requirements for running the app

In order to run the program correctly you need:

- At least one camera connected to the PC

[Optionaly] To activate the voice functionality you need: 

- the program Dragon Naturally Speaking installed and running on your machine

## Contact

Let me know whether you have any doubt about the project or something does not work.
